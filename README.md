## Template Installation
All the Xcode custom template files are located in ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Templates/ and grouped into sections by folder name. Create a folder with name `Custom Templates` manually or by running the following command from the terminal:
```
mkdir ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Templates/Custom\ Templates
```

Open `Custom Templates` dir with Finder:
```
open ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Templates/Custom\ Templates
```

Now drag and drop the `*.xctemplate` that included with the repo to the `Custom Templates` directory. Now templates can be selected from File Templates.
